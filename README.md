# 👋 Hey, I’m Umer

I build **fast, clean, and scalable web interfaces**.  
Mostly living in the React + TypeScript world, with a soft obsession for **frontend performance** and **developer experience**.

## 🧠 Things I Care About

- ⚡ Making the web *feel* fast, not just load fast  
- 🧩 Designing components that age well  
- 🔍 Fixing invisible performance problems before users notice  
- ✨ Clean abstractions over clever hacks

## ⚙️ What I Usually End Up Doing

- Turning **slow UIs into smooth ones**
- Refactoring large codebases without breaking things
- Building reusable components that don’t fight developers
- Making TypeScript work *for* the team, not against it

---

## 🧪 Testing & Tooling

- Jest  
- React Testing Library  
- Cypress (selectively)  
- Git · CI/CD basics

---

## 🧩 Background Trivia

- Started with **Angular**, stayed for the discipline  
- Moved to **React**, stayed for the flexibility  
- Performance engineering became a habit, not a task  
- Prefer clarity over buzzwords  

---

## 🌱 Currently

- Exploring deeper React internals  
- Improving DX patterns  
- Keeping UIs fast as apps grow
